# CSE 110: Software Engineering Project

Project Overview:
This app is build for Android and serves as a party-planning app that will show a list of Facebook friends who also use the app. You can create an event and invite people to it and specify the meet up location, which will be marked on the app via Google Maps. The event will be Facebook-styled in that you will be able to set the time, location, and description. Everyone associated with the event will be able to access the map, which displays car markers. Users can sign up to be drivers to the event and other users can sign up for car near them. Group members can also see a list of items that all event attendees are bringing to the event. Finally the app manages your account by signing in with Facebook which allows you to send event invitations to your Facebook friends.

This project utilized the agile and scrum methodology. Milestones were used to guide the project and keep development on track for achieving the minimum viable product, along with a burn down chart to visualize progress. Milestones were further broken down into User Stories ranked by importance to guide development of features for the app.
